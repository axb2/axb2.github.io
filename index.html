    <section id="privacy-policy" class="card">
      <div class="section-anchor">Section A</div>
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="meta">
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Rainyday Apps</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”)
        collects and uses information in connection with the <strong>Mr. Johnson</strong> app (“the App”).
        We are committed to complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable privacy laws.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Data Controller &amp; Contact</h3>
      <p>
        The data controller responsible for your personal data in relation to the App is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rainyday Apps</strong><br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:teamrainydays@gmail.com">teamrainydays@gmail.com</a>
      </p>

      <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>

      <h4>2.1 Optional Personal Data You Provide</h4>
      <p>
        Within the App, you may optionally provide the following personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Age</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used only to personalise your experience within the App.
        Providing this information is optional and not required to use the main functionality.
      </p>

      <h4>2.2 Usage Data &amp; Analytics</h4>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymised and aggregated usage data.
        This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>App screens you visit and features you use</li>
        <li>Time spent in the App</li>
        <li>General device information (such as device model, OS version, language)</li>
        <li>Approximate, non-precise location (e.g., country or region)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect precise GPS location.
      </p>

      <h4>2.3 Purchase &amp; Subscription Information</h4>
      <p>
        If the App offers in-app purchases or subscriptions, payments are processed by the relevant App Store (e.g. Apple App Store or Google Play Store).
        We do not receive or store your full payment details.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage and verify your purchase or subscription status.
        RevenueCat receives information related to your purchases (such as product identifiers and subscription status) from the App Store to determine whether premium features should be unlocked.
      </p>

      <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To operate and provide the core functionality of the App</li>
        <li>To personalise your experience (for example, using your name or age within the App interface if you choose to provide them)</li>
        <li>To understand how the App is used so we can improve performance, features and stability</li>
        <li>To verify and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising or targeted marketing, and
        we do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h3>
      <p>
        Under the GDPR, we rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent</strong> – For optional personal information you provide (such as your name and age).
          You can choose not to provide this data or remove it by clearing it in the App or uninstalling the App.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – For collecting basic analytics data necessary to understand how the App is used and to improve its functionality and security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Contractual necessity</strong> – For processing necessary to validate purchases and provide you with any premium features that you have paid for.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Sharing of Data</h3>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> share your personal data with third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only share data with the following service providers, strictly for operating the App:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (Google)<br />
          Used to collect aggregated analytics data to understand app usage and performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RevenueCat</strong><br />
          Used to validate and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers act as data processors or independent controllers under their own privacy terms and are required to process data in accordance
        with applicable data protection laws.
      </p>

      <h3>6. International Data Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the global nature of our service providers (such as Firebase and RevenueCat), your data may be processed on servers located outside your country,
        including outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
      </p>
      <p>
        Where such transfers occur, they are carried out in compliance with GDPR using appropriate safeguards,
        such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or equivalent lawful mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        We retain your data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Optional in-app information (such as name and age) is kept only as long as it remains stored in your app instance.
          You can delete it by clearing the data fields or uninstalling the App.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analytics data is retained by our providers for limited periods to help us understand usage trends and app performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Purchase-related data is retained as needed to maintain your access to purchased content and comply with App Store and legal requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>8. Your Rights (GDPR)</h3>
      <p>
        If you are located in the EEA or another jurisdiction with similar rights, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you</li>
        <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
        <li>The right to request deletion of your personal data (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
        <li>The right to restrict or object to certain processing</li>
        <li>The right to data portability (in certain circumstances)</li>
        <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time for processing based on consent</li>
        <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe that a child has provided personal data to us without appropriate consent, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Security</h3>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h3>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
